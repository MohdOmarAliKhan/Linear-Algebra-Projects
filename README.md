Problem Statement: This project provides a way to first encrypt and then compress images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It secures image data from unauthorized access and reduces file size, making it easier to store and send. This technique is useful for areas like medical images, surveillance, and cloud storage where secure, smaller images are needed.
